Description: Analysis of oxygen consumption data generated by Loligo Systems respirometry equipment. The package includes a function for loading data output by 'AutoResp' software (get.witrox.data()), functions for calculating metabolic rates over user-specified time intervals, extracting critical points from data using broken stick regressions based on Yeager and Ultsch (1989), eand easy functions for converting between different units of barometric pressure.
